## What is Donner App?
 Donner is an app that enables you to donate clothes to orphanages, shelters, refugee camps and anywhere else clothes are needed across Africa.

## Donner’s Impact on Society
It was discovered that there was a gap between people’s wish 
to donate and their ability to do so. Donner was designed to
allow users to donate clothes to people who need it anywhere
in Africa, in the most convenient way possible. In this age of 
digitalization, every service is looking to go digital. Donation
as a digital service has been overlooked in this part of the world. Not Anymore.
